    This is a mock website in production to show a simple, static HTML website (with a few links to other websites that were used as well as a link to the school)
    using Docker and NGINX to make my computer my own server and host this website on Local Host
  </h3>

  <p>
    Among the many things I have learned in this course, setting up Docker, NGINX, Apache, using a htaccess file, and altering configuration files to make the website
    perform how I want it to perform; Setting up Docker had to be the hardest part. Configuring the server files was fairly simple and easy to understand. I understand that 
    the course is set to be reworked in the near future and will change the assignments and material around quite a bit. I would consider having more of a focus on learning
    docker itself rather than configuration is a good idea. For me, docker has been extremely finicky and fragile. Almost everything I attempt to do will result in an error
    of some kind on the first try(lol). As I used Docker more and more, I started to understand it and get the hang of it, it just takes time. That's why I believe that 
    spending more time learning Docker would be very beneficial.
